I was unable to push my data files (.csv) into github. 
They are extremely heavy.

It's possible to get them through the code.
I must warn you that it will take quite a lot of time.
The dataset has 35000 entries and code will make it run web scrapping for all instances.

Please contact me if you would like to have the intermediate datasets.
